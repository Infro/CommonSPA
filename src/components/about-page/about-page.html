<p>
  Welcome, welcome, come in and make yourself at home.
  So, how have your travels been faring?
  That so, that so, yes, life is often happenstances of miracles, disasters, and everything inbetween, which is all the more reason to leave as little to luck as possible.
  Ah, sadly no, I don't have anything to give away, but I have some great things you can earn if you'd prefer; you see, I find myself earning something far more rewarding than having something.
  Ah, you have a problem that you could use help with?  Certainly I might be able to assist depending on what is in it for me and whats in it for you.
  Certainly, lets make this into being productive and solving problems.  What would help with that is simply explaining what you you believe would be a great way to progress youself and society forward?
  How can we simplify this hope process so it'll be simpler.  First, explain what has happened in your life that you don't want to tolerate it ever repeating again.
